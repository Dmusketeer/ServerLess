8. What programming languages are supported by AWS Lambda?

Answer: `AWS Lambda` supports a variety of programming languages. As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, the following languages are officially supported by AWS Lambda:

1. Node.js
2. Python
3. Ruby
4. Java
5. Go
6. .NET Core (C#)
7. PowerShell
8. Custom Runtime (for languages not officially supported)

Please note that the supported languages may change over time as AWS updates its services. You can check the AWS Lambda documentation for the most up-to-date information on supported runtimes and languages. If you have a specific language in mind that is not on the list, you might consider using the "Custom Runtime" option, which allows you to run functions in other languages as long as you can bundle the necessary runtime and dependencies with your deployment package.
